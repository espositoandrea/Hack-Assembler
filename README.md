## The Project
The project is an Assembler for the *Hack* language. It was created for "Project 6" of the course *"From Nand to Tetris"* and the book *"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"* by Noam *Nisan* and Shimon *Schocken*.
### Known Bugs and Limitations
- This assembler cannot check the sintax of the instructions.
- This assembler is based on a simple sostitution of substrings, though it is not the best way to do it.
- ~~This assembler does not recognize instructions with white spaces in them.~~
